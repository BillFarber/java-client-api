<h2>MarkLogic Java API</h2>
<p>
	The MarkLogic Java API support reading, writing, and deleting
	document content and metadata as well as querying documents.
</p>

<h2>Before Starting</h2>
<p>
	Before using the API, create a REST server for your database.
	If the database has existing documents, modify the roles with
	privileges to read and write those documents to inherit from
	rest-reader and rest-writer. 
</p>
<h2>Creating a Database Client</h2>
<p>
	Use {@link com.marklogic.client.DatabaseClientFactory}.connect()
	to create a client for a database.  You can then use the
	{@link com.marklogic.client.DatabaseClient} factory methods
	(which begin with "new") to create document, configuration,
	and query managers.
</p>
<h2>Working with Document Managers</h2>
<p>
	Use the {@link com.marklogic.client.DatabaseClient} to create
	the appropriate document manager for the format of the content --
	a {@link com.marklogic.client.BinaryDocumentManager} for a binary
	document, an {@link com.marklogic.client.XMLDocumentManager} for
	an XML document, and so on.
</p>
<p>
	Create a {@link com.marklogic.client.DocumentIdentifier} with the
	URI of the document in the database.
</p>
<p>
	Create a handle for the document content in the representation that you
	need.  For instance, to read a binary document into a temporary file,
	create a {@link com.marklogic.client.io.FileHandle}.  To read an XML
	document into a DOM, create a {@link com.marklogic.client.io.DOMHandle}.
</p>
<p>
	To read document content from the database, pass the 
	{@link com.marklogic.client.DocumentIdentifier} and
	content handle to the read() method of the document manager and then use the
	methods of the handle to get the content.  To write document content to the
	database, set the content in a handle and then pass the 
	{@link com.marklogic.client.DocumentIdentifier} and
	content handle to the write() method of the document manager.
</p>
<p>
	You can read or write document metadata in the same request as document
	content or separately.
</p>
<h2>Working with the Search Option Manager</h2>
<p>
	To search in a database, you create indexes on the fields and elements
	of documents and define constraints that specify how to search on these
	indexes.  Use {@link com.marklogic.client.QueryOptionsManager} to write,
	read, and delete search options. 
</p>
<h2>Working with the Query Manager</h2>
<p>
	Use {@link com.marklogic.client.QueryManager} to search documents or
	extract values, co-occurrences of values, or full tuple records from
	document indexes.  The search() method takes the name for search options
	that you wrote to the database previously, a query definition including
	the search criteria, and a handle for representing the results.  You can
	supply search criteria as a string, keys-value pairs, or a structure.
	You can	represent results as JSON, XML, or a Java data structure.
