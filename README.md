# The MarkLogic Java Client

The MarkLogic Java Client makes it easy to write, read, delete, and find documents
in a [MarkLogic](http://developer.marklogic.com/) database. The client requires connecting to a 
[MarkLogic REST API app server](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/rest-dev) and is ideal for applications wishing to 
build upon the MarkLogic REST API. 

The client supports the following core features of the MarkLogic database:

*  Write and read binary, JSON, text, and XML documents.
*  Query data structure trees, marked-up text, and all the hybrids in between those extremes.
*  Project values, tuples, and triples from hierarchical documents and aggregate over them.
*  Patch documents with partial updates.
*  Use Optimistic Locking to detect contention without creating locks on the server.
*  Execute ACID modifications so the change either succeeds or throws an exception.
*  Execute multi-statement transactions so changes to multiple documents succeed or fail together.
*  Call Data Services by means of a Java interface on the client for data functionality 
implemented by an endpoint on the server.

The client can be used in applications running on Java 8, 11, and 17. If you are using Java 11 or higher and intend
to use [JAXB](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/), please see the section below for ensuring that the
necessary dependencies are available in your application's classpath.

## QuickStart

To use the client in your [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project, include the following in your `pom.xml` file:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.marklogic</groupId>
        <artifactId>marklogic-client-api</artifactId>
        <version>6.4.1</version>
    </dependency>

To use the client in your [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) project, include the following in your `build.gradle` file:

    dependencies {
        implementation "com.marklogic:marklogic-client-api:6.4.1"
    }

Next, read [The Java API in Five Minutes](http://developer.marklogic.com/try/java/index) to get started.

Full documentation is available at:

* [Java Application Developer's Guide](http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/java)
* [JavaDoc](http://docs.marklogic.com/javadoc/client/index.html)

## Including JAXB support 

If you are using Java 11 or higher (including Java 17) and you wish to use [JAXB](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/)
with the client, you'll need to include JAXB API and implementation dependencies as those are no 
longer included in Java 11 and higher.

For Maven, include the following in your pom.xml file:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
        <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>
        <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.2</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>
        <artifactId>jaxb-core</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.0.1</version>
    </dependency>

For Gradle, include the following in your build.gradle file (this can be included in the same `dependencies` block 
as the one that includes the marklogic-client-api dependency):

    dependencies {
        implementation "javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api:2.3.1"
        implementation "org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime:2.3.2"
        implementation "org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-core:2.3.0.1"
    }

You are free to use any implementation of JAXB that you wish, but you need to ensure that you're using a JAXB 
implementation that corresponds to the `javax.xml.bind` interfaces. JAXB 3.0 and 4.0 interfaces are packaged under 
`jakarta.xml.bind`, and the Java API does not yet depend on those interfaces. 

Thus, you are free to include an implementation of JAXB 3.0 or 4.0 in your project for your own use; it will not 
affect the Java API. A caveat though is if you are trying to use different major versions of the same JAXB 
implementation library - such as `org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime` - then you will run into an expected dependency 
conflict between the two versions of the library. This can be worked around by using a different implementation of 
JAXB 3.0 or JAXB 4.0 - for example:

    dependencies {
        // JAXB 2 dependencies required by Java Client
        implementation "javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api:2.3.1"
        implementation "org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime:2.3.2"
        implementation "org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-core:2.3.0.1"
        
        // JAXB 4 dependencies required by other application code
        implementation "jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api:4.0.0"
        implementation "com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl:4.0.1"
    }

The client will soon be updated to use the newer `jakarta.xml.bind` interfaces. Until then, the above approach
or one similar to it will allow for both the old and new JAXB interfaces and implementations to exist together in the
same classpath.
