# The MarkLogic Java Client API

The API makes it easy to write, read, delete, and find documents
in a [MarkLogic](http://developer.marklogic.com/) database.

For example:

    // write a text, binary, XML, or JSON document from any source with ACID guarantees
    documentManager.write(uri, new FileHandle()
      .with(new File("file1234.json"))
      .withFormat(JSON));

    // read and directly parse to your preferred type, even your own POJOs!
    JsonNode jsonDocContents = documentManager.readAs(uri, JsonNode.class);

    // get matches super-fast using full-featured search
    JsonNode results = queryManager.search(
      new StructuredQueryBuilder().term("quick", "brown", "fox"),
      new JacksonHandle()).get();

The Java API supports the following core features of the MarkLogic database:

*  Write and read binary, JSON, text, and XML documents.
*  Query data structure trees, marked-up text, and all the hybrids in between those extremes.
*  Project values, tuples, and triples from hierarchical documents and aggregate over them.
*  Patch documents with partial updates.
*  Use Optimistic Locking to detect contention without creating locks on the server.
*  Execute ACID modifications so the change either succeeds or throws an exception.
*  Execute multi-statement transactions so changes to multiple documents succeed or fail together.
*  Call Data Services by means of a Java interface on the client for data functionality 
implemented by an endpoint on the server.

## QuickStart

To use the API in your maven project, include the following in your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.marklogic</groupId>
        <artifactId>marklogic-client-api</artifactId>
        <version>6.0.0</version>
    </dependency>

For gradle projects, use gradle 4.x+ and include the following:

    dependencies {
        compile "com.marklogic:marklogic-client-api:6.0.0"
    }
