/**
 * The package provides classes for making calls to Data Service endpoints.
 * Use {@link com.marklogic.client.DatabaseClient} to create the call manager.
 * Create a caller and either make single calls with the caller or build
 * a call batcher to make multiple concurrent calls.
 *
 * Note that the ml-development-tools generates interfaces to make it
 * easy to call Data Service endpoints.
